## Lawyer Dashboard

As a LegalTech company, we are always looking for ways to make life easier for our lawyers. To do this, we must ensure lawyers have access to relevant information at their fingertips to enable them to work efficiently.

A recent challenge we have faced in the company was lawyers not having a realtime high-level overview of what was being worked on at the moment. We get lots of requests daily and we need to have a view of our overall workload in order to know how best to allocate our resources.

For this challenge, you will be building a dashboard using HTML/CSS and Javascript, that will report the following information:

- Total number of requests
- Number of requests in progress
- Lawyers available
- Requests per lawyer
- New cases today

This dashboard is one of the pages in a bigger system being built to enable our lawyer better manage their workload.

Here's a low-fidelity wireframe of the system:

What we'll be looking out for:

- Semantic HTML code
- Clean design
- Use of Javascript data structures to manage information to be rendered
- Micro-interaction design

As a bonus:

Of course you don't have to do all of this but we expect that you make this as best as you possibly can.

You may use any Javascript technologies of your choosing (Vanilla Javscript, Vue, React, Angular etc.)
